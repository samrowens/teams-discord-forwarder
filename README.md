---

# Getting Started

### Make sure you have python installed

```Link to get python 3.10.11 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/ ```

 This is the version I'm using for the project, it doesn't have to be the exact same so long as it is greater than 3.10 and not less. 3.9 and under have some pretty major differences that may get in the way. 

### Make sure you also have git installed

```https://git-scm.com/install/windows```


### If you would like to use the coding editor I use

```https://code.visualstudio.com/```


# 1. Clone this repository

### Navigate to a newly created folder for the project then

- Clone the project up in the top right via the green code button
- Click the  Https tab, copy the link

Then in your terminal do
```git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git```



# 2. Create a virtual environment in your preffered editor


 ```python -m venv .venv  ```

 ### then if your terminal doesn't show (.venv)

 ```.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```



 # 3. Install Dependencies 

 ```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```
```pip install discord.py```
```pip install python-dotenv```


# 4. Create a .env file for environment variables

 You will use your own generated keys for this file, though I will give you access to my sandbox discord for testing purposes. You will never have to use 'Production keys' during development. 

 Type in this file


```DC_API_KEY = ```

 then you will put in quotes here the API key for discord which I will give out or if someone wants to make their own testing environment here is a link to Discord on how to do that
